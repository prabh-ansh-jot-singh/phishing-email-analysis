# Phishing Email Analysis Task

## Objective
Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample to understand email threats and social engineering techniques.

## Tools Used
- Email client or saved email file (`.txt`)
- Free online email header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox)

## Steps Performed
1. Obtained a sample phishing email (`phishing_sample.txt`)  
2. Analyzed sender email for spoofing (e.g., support@amaz0n.com)  
3. Checked email headers for discrepancies (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)  
4. Identified suspicious links in the email body  
5. Looked for urgent or threatening language  
6. Verified spelling and grammar errors  
7. Documented phishing traits in `phishing_report.md`  
8. Took screenshots of email body and header analysis (`screenshots/`)  

## Key Findings
- Spoofed sender email address  
- Suspicious link domain (does not match official company)  
- Social engineering using urgency and threats  
- Spelling/grammar mistakes  
- (Optional) Header discrepancies if analyzed  

## Deliverables
- `phishing_sample.txt` → phishing email content  
- `phishing_report.md` → detailed analysis of phishing traits  
- `screenshots/` → images of email body and header analysis  

## Outcome
- Gained awareness of phishing tactics  
- Learned how to detect spoofed emails and suspicious links  
- Developed email threat analysis skills
